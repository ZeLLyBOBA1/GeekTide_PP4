## Agile Methodology

### MoSCoW prioritization

In development process, I followed Agile principles to ensure flexibility and continuous improvement. I used the MoSCoW method to prioritize features and tasks. This method helped me to focus on what’s most important.

| Priority Level   | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Must Have**    | Essential features that are critical for the platform's core functionality and success.                |
| **Should Have**  | Important features that add significant value but can be delayed if necessary without major impact.    |
| **Could Have**   | Nice-to-have features that enhance the user experience but are not essential for the initial launch.    |
| **Won't Have**   | Features that are either not needed for this phase or have been deprioritized for future consideration. |

### GitHub Projects

I used GitHub Projects to organize and track my development progress. This helped me to manage tasks, prioritize work, and stay on schedule. My project board is divided into columns, such as "To Do", "In Progress", "Done", and "Won`t have" allowing me to visualize the workflow and ensure that nothing is left behind.
